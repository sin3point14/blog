title: GSoC-3 Adding a Cube to xrdesktop
date: 2021-8-21

Now that I have a good grash of Cubes by working on gulkan, I start my new adventure of adding a Cube to xrdesktop.  
Turns out there used to be a kind of generalised 3D mesh renderer in xrdesktop, but its gone in the next branch so... oh well.

I start my adventure by creating [environment.c](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/sin3point14/xrdesktop/-/blob/1da38833293c89111cc0b32fbe638f352894a466/examples/environment.c) example that jut initialises `xrd-shell` without any widget, hence we get a pure black world with nothing but a grid. I dont't have a screenshot for it but well what's so special about it anyway :p.  

So I added A [G3kModel](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/sin3point14/xrdesktop/-/blob/1da38833293c89111cc0b32fbe638f352894a466/src/g3k-model.c) class by basically copy pasting [G3kBackground](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/sin3point14/xrdesktop/-/blob/1da38833293c89111cc0b32fbe638f352894a466/src/g3k-background.c) class. I ported the `VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_LIST` version of VkCube I prepared in gulkan to `G3kModel` and added a [new pipeline to G3kRenderer](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/sin3point14/xrdesktop/-/commit/fa016e87d754fc9e80a7d0650ce9858d2740fd6f#69fa0650cc0c1c5f1c9cae91e4871d261b521844_447_431).

After a series of hiccups, I got a Cube rendering :).
