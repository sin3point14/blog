title: GSoC-2 Adding a texture + Normal maps!
date: 2021-7-30

So turns out I was missing updating the change in number of vertex attributes (3 -> 4) and descriptor set counts (1 -> 2) after adding a new attribute for uv and a new descriptor set for a texture :p  
A [tiny commit](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/sin3point14/gulkan/-/commit/629f2c49be0a9013851060b32ac20085e741fed0) did the job

Adding another texture(normal map) is pretty trivial, all i had to do was refer my previous to commits and repeat the changes for adding a texture.  
Now comes the hard part, TANGENTS!!!  
Normally 3D file formats are pretty mercifuls and provide tangents in the asset file itself. BUT since this example is based off the [vkcube](https://github.com/krh/vkcube) example, it becomes my job to calculate all the tangents.
Now tanget is supposed to point in the direcction of the U axis of the uv coordinate space, and thankfully since I have a cube that doesn't have any skewing in textures, the Tangent _should_ be the 3D displacement vector between the vertex with uv coord (0,0) and uv coord (1,0), [right](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/sin3point14/gulkan/-/commit/fcd46649df576cfbc909ac147569694ae66ae104#b95593e7f6deb44a78a39fe2101db6c1472e4800)?(ok that was a lie :p, the _etter_ tangents are [here](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/sin3point14/gulkan/-/commit/b89d6a3f335b5e403ebb6f8399ba2c22a9838d42#b95593e7f6deb44a78a39fe2101db6c1472e4800_166_166))  
Assuming that these manually tangent are fine I added the Normal map decompression, transformation of the sampled vector to tangent space and applying the sweet bump effect in the shader [here](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/sin3point14/gulkan/-/commit/b89d6a3f335b5e403ebb6f8399ba2c22a9838d42#b3f71ab9242383910df954a1ed7602e8c163c031).

Looks... like something?
I mean yeah, it does look like there are some bumps but something feels off. But well at this point I gave up on fixing the tangents(4 faces seem to behave fine so that's good enough as a PoC), and will fix this when i get some proper data from a proper asset file.  

Until next time!  
PS: Stay tuned for some model loading action in the next post!
