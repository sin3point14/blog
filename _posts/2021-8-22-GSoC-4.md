title: GSoC-4 Loading glTF models
date: 2021-8-22
---

The journey from a simple in memory Cube to a fully fledged glTF loader is something that I cannot possibly express in words, but the end result was worth it.

HUGE thanks to [Gthree](https://github.com/alexlarsson/gthree/) as the core loader logic is completely based of it and it wouldn't have been possible to finish this project in time without it. Also thanks to the [glTF sample models repo by Khronos Group](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/) to give free to use models for testing.

I took [GthreeLoader](https://github.com/alexlarsson/gthree/blob/master/gthree/gthreeloader.c), dumped it to `G3kLoader` and started hacking on it. Now It would be impossible to go around explaning 2.5k lines of code but the loading process can be boiled down to this code snippet

```c
  if (!parse_asset (loader, root, &error))
    return NULL;

  if (!parse_buffers (loader, root, bin, base_path, &error))
    return NULL;

  if (!parse_buffer_views (loader, root, &error))
    return NULL;

  if (!parse_accessors (loader, root, &error))
    return NULL;

  // // careful here
  // if (!parse_samplers (loader, root, &error))
  //   return NULL;

  // if (!parse_images (loader, root, base_path, &error))
  //   return NULL;

  // if (!parse_textures (loader, root, &error))
  //   return NULL;

  // skipping for now
  // if (!parse_materials (loader, root, &error))
  //   return NULL;

  if (!parse_meshes (loader, root, &error))
    return NULL;

  // if (!parse_nodes (loader, root, base_path, &error))
  //   return NULL;

  // if (!parse_scenes (loader, root, &error))
  //   return NULL;
```

You'll see a lot of code is commented as my first aim was to simply get POSITION, NORMAL and INDEX data loaded and render a simple [G3kMesh](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/sin3point14/xrdesktop/-/blob/f38a0680ee083d0bbe6ac54a4a74cad3672af68d/src/g3k-mesh.c) in a hacky manner. After a couple week's struggle, I got a Cube loading :)

I was feeling lucky and though to load a Duck model as well...

After some fixes...

Also say hi to Suzanne.

Lubosz had been working on allowing dynamic attributes in gulkan's vertex buffer API and had completed his work, so I ported my work to the new API. And I got some cool glitchporn instead :p

So something was still wrong, I spent some time with lubosz and haagch hooking up renderdoc to figure wtf is going wrong and turns out the pipeline configured with incorrect binding properties.

I uncommented `parse_textures`, `parse_samplers` and `parse_materials` and added a crude Material struct that allows for nothing but a diffuse texture. [Baby steps!](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/sin3point14/xrdesktop/-/commit/8e4c060809b640144de48e089c0975f329de7326)

And we get Phong Shaded Suzanne in VR!

I went ahead with adding a scene tree implementation, but for some reason it just renders the deepest model in the tree for 2 models arranged in a parent child hierarchy. I am not sure what the issue is, mauybe it is because I edited the glTF file by hand and missed something or perhaps the code I wrote is shit. But the end of GSoC is only a couple of days away so I skipped this and went ahead with cleaning up all the commented code and hacks I had used. This marks the end of my GSoC 2021 Journey with xrdesktop :)
